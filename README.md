# Self-Assembling-Networks
This model explores how a social network might self-assemble from the ritualization of the decisions of individual agents. These models show how inquiry in an evolved social network may be significantly more reliable than the individual inquiry of the agents. They also show how such networks may dramatically lower the epistemic risk faced by each inquirer. We consider both models of both perfect and imperfect communication and compare the evolved behavior of inquirers in each.
